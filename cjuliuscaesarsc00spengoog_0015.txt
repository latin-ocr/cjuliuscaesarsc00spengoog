common comant. 'I'he scandalum combination ol these three great men was
called the first triumvirate. Ol the three, Pompey was the least criminer.
He appears to have been duped ογ the insinuating address ol Caesar, in whose
consulship he expected teget his acts in Asia ratified. The decree could only
gratily his vanity‚ which was his ruling pentem but the means which he
employed to accemplish it were highly criminal. 'Ihe object ol Cremna was
to edd to his wealth‚ and to mamaea his intluence in the nate, ογ the power
and talenta os the other two ; and that ol Caesar, ογ measiourdly yielding te
Pompey’s lame, to rahe his own, ‘⁸ and orown his med ambition.”

From this period the state was wholly managed by Caesam and the violence
os his proceedings rendered the triumviri objecta ol just abhorrenoe to all classes
oi the community. Cicero, to whom Pompey musessed he had been duped
by Caesar, advised him to break off all connection with that intriguing and
nnprincipled politieian; but with him the winning address el Caesar had more
intluence, who not only preserved their former intimacy, iu opposition to the
advice ot' Cicero, but strengthened their union by giving Pompey‚ in marriage,
his daughter Julia, a woman of the most amiable disymitious, and os the most
engaging manners. So great was her inlinenoe with both her father and
husband, that, in mite os the mutual jealorrsy and aversion which ailerwards
mbeisted between them, she prevented their coming to any rupture es long as
she lived To increase his power in the state, and te command the interest ol
Piso, who snmeeded him in the consulship, he married his daughter Calpnmia.
A strong and respectable party, animated ογ love of their country, then began
wannly to oppose the measuresos the triumvirate. Caesar, anxious to intimi·
date mem, bribed Vettius, who had formerly preferred an accusation against
humen, to deelare, that he had been urged by some os the nobles to maminoto
Pompey. But this villainy, being detected ογ the people, was treated with
such contempt, that he was glad to drop it; and to prevent discovery, he put
Vettius to death in prison. Notwithstanding these acte os enormity, he still
menneo a very powerlul party in the state. Previously te the expiratiou of his
consulship, he obtained from the people, through his egem, the tribune
Vatinius, the province ol Gellia Cisalpina, and illyricum, Upper Albania, with
nnee legions tor live years; and the senate, at the desire ol Caesar, added
Gallia Transalpina, and another legion. These legions were gradually in-
meased to thirteen. Some ol the snooeediug magistrates wished to annul hia
eeu. and to prosecute him lor his illegal conduct during his consulship; but,
having the tribunes in his intereat, a veto was put on all their proceedlngs.

Caesar set out sor Gaul, early in the spring ol s. o. 58. Of his conquestos
