the most wichad and flagitious. But, in spite oi his vices* the agreeableness
ei his manners and splendor oi his talenta, added to hia martial valor end
intrepidity, gained him many admirere. The success ot' his military euterprises
rendered him a favorite with the army, and his profuse bribery secured in
hie interest the populace of Rome. That his object, from his early years,
had been his own aggrandinement on the ruin oi his country, is manifest
imm his having been concemed, tirst, in the conspiracy ot Crassus end Sylla,
and, afterwards, in that of Catiline.† The judgment which he gave in the
senate, with respect to the punishment os Lentulus, Cethegus, dac, accom-
plices ot* Catiline, the conduct oi the Roman hhuites who guarded the temple
where the mnata was met, and his being anaigned as aa associate oi that
rebel, before the Quaestor and the senate, sufficiently preve both the public
opinion and his guilt. He leagued withthese traitors, not to promote their
schemen, bnt by their means to destroy the liberties os his country, and become
the unlimited sovereign os Rome.

Ceesardivorced Pompeia, because Clodius had been detected in his house,
while she and other matrons were celebrating the rites os Bona Dea, from
which every male creature was most caretully excluded. Clodius was tried
ior this adme, and, through bribery, dbtained a sentence oi acquittal. As
Clodius was a man os great intluence and popularity, Caesar, although cer-

at any future period, been in the smallest degree injurious to his plens oi am·

The senate seem ιο have been apprehensive os the power end intluence ot'

provinces os little or uo importance, woods and reads, to the consuis sor that

between Pompey and Crassus, which ho at lest, aiter great exertion, accom-
plishe'd. The interest ot the former he had keenly supported in the passing ot
the Maniliae law, which conferred extraordinary powers οιι that commender,
and lilrewise on other occasions, though not without an ultimate view to his
own advantage. Whatever power, beyond what was usual, had been assigned
