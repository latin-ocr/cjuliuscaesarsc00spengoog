Tun teet os the present edition of Caesar’s Com-
mentarios on the Gallio War is substantially that of Ι
Oudendorp. The variations introduced were drawn
from a oaresul comparison of Oudendorp's text with
those of Achaintre and Lemaire, oberlin, Schneider,

Giani, &o.; and the Editor felt the less hesitation in -
adopting this course because of the aoknowledged eor· w.

rupt state of the tent.l Hence, wherever a reading
appeared to him more in accordanoe with Caesar’s usual

· style or manner, he has ventured to adopt it in prefer-

enoe to the leotion of Oudendorp.

The sources from whioh the notes have been mainly
drawn are the following: Oudendorp's large edition of
the works of Caesar, with the Notes ol D. Vossius,
J. Davies, and Sam. Clarke, Stutgard, 1822, 2 vols,
Bvo. ; Graevius’s edition of Caesar's works, with the
Notes os Vossius, Davies, and others, Leyden, 1713,
·8vo.; Barker’s Caesar's Commentarios on the Gallio

' “'l'he text of Caeser’s Commeatum· is elno so corrupt, end has in
the luter editions hoen sometimes ιο unheppily corrected, thet 1 dread tho
period when 1 shall heve to follow it es the mein authority ol my amative,
ond een no longor look to Niebuhr'· ugaeity for guidauoe.”-Aroold’s
