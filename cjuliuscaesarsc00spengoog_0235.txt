'l'he Farther l’rovince being tranquilined, caesar determined that the rosd by the
pasees oi the Alps, on which travellers and merchants were exposed to many
Ι dangers‚ and heavy imposts, should hc rendered a safer thoroughiare and me·
diurn oi commerce between Italy and Gaul.

with the view οἰ intimidating and coercing the maranding clane, he sent Galba,
· with one legion, ιο winter among them ς but, niter a hazardons, although snc-
cessful encounter with thirty thousand mountsineers, thet officer vves forced
tn retrece his steps, and pitch his winter-camp within the husan province.

During the same-winter, whilst he shode ln -the remote province oi illyricum,
information reached Caesar that the Annoric. or maritime states, du the west,
coast oi Celtic Gaul, had formed a combination with the honitani and Belgae ;
were making warlihe preparatione on a great scsle t and, setting at dedance
the lew cinelinus, hudthrown his envoys into prison. He dispatched orders
that stripping should be built on the Loire, and lost no time in hastening in
person to the scene ot action. Hsving sent three dividens oi his forces against
as many sections oi ihs ethes, he chose, es his own opponente, the Veneti, the .
most poweriul maritime tribe. Α γ

ln the absence ot hie teet, his first undertaking was ιο storin their towns, and
subdue them by land; hut this he discovered to be a fruitless euterprtse. Their
towns, generally well tortified, were situete on peninsulas or promontories;
sud their own transports, with those collected from the adjacent states, and
from Britain, assemhled at any place to which he laid siege, in eo great nurn-
bors, that they could easily convey the population, with their effecte, irom one
town to another. By this policy, they gave his troops employment during a
grem part of the summer.

Brutus, a young man whom he had appointed admiral. errired with the ieet,
formed his line-oihatde near the coast, and received the abach os the Veneti
in presence oi caesar and the army. The action tested from ten in the rnorn
ing till mnset. From their superior adeptation to the tides and tempests
ot the* ocean, and the great height ot their decks, Brutus had to copo with ·
many ufficdues in hoerding the enemy‘s vessels, but this pmpose having at
length been carried into execution, the Rorpm discipline prevsiled, and iew
